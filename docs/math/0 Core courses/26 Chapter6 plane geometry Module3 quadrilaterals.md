# Module 6-03 Quadrilateral

## 1.Parallelogram
The lengths of the two sides of the parallelogram are $a,b$,
the height with $b$ as the base is $h$, the area is $S=bh$, and the perimeter is $C=2(a+b)$.

## 2.Rectangle
The lengths of the two sides of the rectangle are $a,b$, the area is $S=ab$, the perimeter is $C=2(a+b)$, and the diagonal is $l=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.

## 3.Rhombus
The length of the four sides of rhombus is $a$,
the height with $a$ as the base is $h$, the area is $S=ah=\frac{1}{2}l_1l_2$,
where $l_1,l_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals respective, and the perimeter is $C=4a$.

$S=\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{l_1}{2}\times\frac{l_2}{2}\times4=\frac{l_1 \cdot l_2}{2}$

## 4.Square
The length of the four sides of a square is $a$,
the four internal angles are $90^\circ$, the area is $S=a^2$, and the perimeter is $C=4a$.

## 5.Trapezoid
- The upper base of the trapezoid is $a$, the lower base is $b$, the height is $h$,
the median is $l=\frac{1}{2}(a+b)$, and the area is $S=\frac{1}{2}(a+b)h$.

- Note: There are two special types of trapezoids — the isosceles trapezoid and the right trapezoid.

## 6.Butterfly Theorem
The butterfly theorem provides us with a way
to solve the area problem of irregular quadrilaterals by constructing a model;
on the one hand, 
the area relationship of the irregular quadrilateral can be linked to the triangles inside the quadrilateral,
on the other hand, 
the proportional relationship of the diagonal corresponding to the area can also be obtained.


### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{1}}\:$Proportional relations in any quadrilateral (Figure 6–23)  
1. $\frac{S_1}{S_2}=\frac{S_4}{S_3}=\frac{OD}{OB}$   
   According to the ratio of areas of triangles with equal heights being equal to the ratio of their bases,
   we have $S_1 \times S_3=S_2 \times S_4$.   
2. According to the geometric theorem $\frac{S_1}{S_2}=\frac{S_4}{S_3}=\frac{OD}{OB}=\frac{S_1+S_4}{S_2+S_3}$.         
   Similarly, $\frac{S_1+S_2}{S_4+S_3}=\frac{AO}{OC}$.   

### $\textcolor{#1E3A5F}{\fbox{2}}\:$The Butterfly theorem of Trapezoid and similar proportions (Figure 6–24)
1. $\frac{S_1}{S_2}=\frac{S_4}{S_3}=\frac{OD}{OB}=\frac{a}{b}$. 
2. $S_1 \times S_3=S_2 \times S_4$.
3. $\frac{S_1}{S_3}=\frac{S_2}{S_2}$ (Similar).
4. $S_2+S_3=S_4+S_3 \implies S_2=S_4$.

- By combining the above four, the unified proportion is obtained: $S_1:S_3:S_2:S_4=a^2:b^2:ab:ab$.
