# Module 6-03 Quadrilateral

## 1.Parallelogram
The lengths of the two sides of the parallelogram are $a,b$,
the height with $b$ as the base is $h$, the area is $S=bh$, and the perimeter is $C=2(a+b)$.

## 2.Rectangle
The lengths of the two sides of the rectangle are $a,b$, the area is $S=ab$, the perimeter is $C=2(a+b)$, and the diagonal is $l=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.

## 3.Rhombus
The length of the four sides of rhombus is $a$,
the height with $a$ as the base is $h$, the area is $S=ah=\frac{1}{2}l_1l_2$,
where $l_1,l_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals respective, and the perimeter is $C=4a$.

$S=\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{l_1}{2}\times\frac{l_2}{2}\times4=\frac{l_1 \cdot l_2}{2}$

## 4.Square
The length of the four sides of a square is $a$,
the four internal angles are $90^\circ$, the area is $S=a^2$, and the perimeter is $C=4a$.

## 5.Trapezoid
- The upper base of the trapezoid is $a$, the lower base is $b$, the height is $h$,
the median is $l=\frac{1}{2}(a+b)$, and the area is $S=\frac{1}{2}(a+b)h$.

- Note: There are two special types of trapezoids â€” the isosceles trapezoid and the right trapezoid.
