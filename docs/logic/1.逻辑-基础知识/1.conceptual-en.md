### subject seven
The researchers recruited 300 overweight men and divided them into a pre-meal exercise group and 
a post-meal exercise group to perform morning workouts of the same intensity and at the same time of day three times a week. 
The pre-meal workout group consumed a zero-calorie placebo drink before their morning workout and 
a 200-calorie milkshake after their morning workout; 
the post-meal workout group consumed a 200-calorie milkshake before their morning workout and 
a zero-calorie placebo drink after their morning workout. After three weeks, 
it was found that the pre-meal workout group burned more fat than the post-meal workout group. 
The researcher deduced from this that obese people who continued such pre-meal 
workouts would be able to improve their metabolism and thus lose weight without increasing the intensity 
or duration of their exercise.

A. The extra metabolism in the pre-meal workout group was associated with less fat in the body's muscles.

or from sugar and fat stored in the body.
